# MuseumCatalogue_XMLProject
Course Project Description: Generating a PDF Museum Catalog using XML, DTD, and XSLT Transformation<br>
Overview<br>
For the XML Technology course at FMI, our project focused on developing a dynamic and automated solution to generate a museum catalog in PDF format. This project leveraged the power of XML for data representation, DTD for data validation, and XSLT for transformation. By combining these technologies, we created a robust system that efficiently converts structured XML data into a polished and professional PDF document.<br>

Project Objectives<br>
Data Representation: Utilize XML to represent detailed information about museum exhibits, including descriptions, images, and metadata.<br>
Data Validation: Implement a Document Type Definition (DTD) to ensure the integrity and validity of the XML data.<br>
Data Transformation: Employ XSLT to transform the XML data into XSL-FO (Formatting Objects) which is then converted into a PDF.<br>
